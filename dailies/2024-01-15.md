The story of "witchcraft" is captivatingly old, tracing its roots back to the dawn of English itself! To answer your question precisely:

**"Witchcraft" emerged as a single word in Old English sometime before the 12th century.** It formed as a compound noun, merging **"wicce" (meaning witch)** and **"cræft" (meaning craft or skill)**. This perfectly reflects the concept of witchcraft as the skilled practice associated with witches.

Interestingly, the terms existed independently within Old English before their fusion. **"Wicca" and "wicce" denoted practitioners of sorcery, with gender differentiation (masculine and feminine forms, respectively).** "Cræft" held diverse meanings like skill, power, knowledge, and even art. Their union in "witchcraft" solidified the association of skill and power with the practices attributed to witches.

Here are some additional tidbits to spark your curiosity:

- While "witchcraft" appeared before the 12th century, its exact date of formation remains debatable due to the evolution of language and documentation.
- The terms "wicca" and "wicce" might have originated from the Old English verb "wiccian," meaning "to practice witchcraft."
- The emergence of "witchcraft" coincides with the growing fear and prosecution of witches throughout Europe, highlighting its use as a label for practices deemed dangerous or heretical.

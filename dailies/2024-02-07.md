Control over our lives,  
An agent of will in an actively anti-human world

The new moon marks the beginning of a new cycle, making it an ideal time to set new goals and intentions. It's a time to focus on new possibilities and opportunities. In February, you can perform rituals such as clearing out old energies, setting goals for the coming year, and inviting fresh energies to help manifest your desires. You can also reflect on what you wish to leave behind and work on letting go of any attachments that may hinder your progress and growth.

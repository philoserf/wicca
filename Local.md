# Local

Together, we may accomplish great and terrible feats that span the globe and reach into the near depths of outer space. I am only one person, so I have limitations in what I can touch.

This is the perspective that guides my beliefs and actions. The absence of wolves in the hills surrounding me means I cannot call the full moon in January a Wolf Moon. The rowan tree, Sorbus Aucuparia, is not indigenous to my home. As a result, the ancient Celtic interpretation of its significance, influence, and symbolism may not be relevant. Even its North American counterpart, Sorbus Americana, is nowhere near me.

I feel a deep connection with the nature that surrounds me. Natural calamities like hurricanes and typhoons that occur far away indirectly affect me. When an atmospheric river hits the coast of California, it may concern me indirectly. When Arctic air reaches the midwestern United States, it affects me directly. However, the significance of nature lies in what happens around me.
